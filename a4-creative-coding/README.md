- the goal of the application is to show the possibilities of 3D rendering in the browser

- a challenging part was getting an orientation of where you have to position things AND the camera to be able to work properly, also rendering things correctly took some time.

- the instructions present in the website should be clear enough to use the application

----
project consists of:

- A server created using Express. This server is as simple as needed.
- A client-side interactive experience using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/): A library for 3D graphics / VR experiences
 
- A user interface for interaction with the project, which lets you change parameters. [dat.gui](https://github.com/dataarts/dat.gui) was used for that.

- The application displays a basic description for the user. There is a winning and loosing button as well, which just reloads the site, thus resetting the game
